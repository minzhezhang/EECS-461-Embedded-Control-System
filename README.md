# EECS-461-Embedded-Control-System
In this project, we write C program to different part on Freescale MPC5643L to build the connections between the microprocessor and the haptic wheel.
Second, we implemented the whole embedded system using rapid prototyping tools to generate C code from a Simulink model of the haptic virtual world, 
        and use control area network (CAN). 
Third, we implemented automatic steering control by designing a PD-PID controller to control the virtual car. 

In the end, we build a simulink model of the virtual car, and also by writing C code we were able to control the virtual car 
            to  automatically drive along the virtual road. We have realized the automatic cruise control and automatic steering control.
            
            
This project can be a good starting point for automated driving.
